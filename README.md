# CarbonBuddy
CarbonBuddy is a simplified, everyday carbon footprint calculator. It allows users to sign up, calculate their carbon footprint, obtain their results, and view resources to reduce your carbon footprint. 

## Key Features 
The key features this application includes are:
* User Profiles: The user is able to create a profile that includes their daily entries
* Local Storage: The userâ€™s data is stored only via local storage
* Activity Logging: The user is able to log their activities in three categories with carbon values: vehicles, electricity, and waste
* Data Visualization: Upon completing the survey, the user is able to view their results through two key data visualizations: a pie chart and bar chart
* Resource Library: The user can learn new ways to improve their carbon footprint and learn more about climate change and sustainability

## Installing and Running CarbonBuddy
To open the application, unzip the zip file. Then, when opened in your preferred editing tool, run npm install to install packages and npm run dev to run the application. 

#### Note: due to technical difficulties on my end, I created the application using node 18.14.0 and npm 9.3.1, which may be needed for the application to run correctly.
